Detection of action(s) producing at least some part of the sounds

Thank you for participating! You must be between 18 and 60 years old, must not have a hearing impairment, must be wearing headphones and must not be listening to other audio.

Rate how likely a given type of action have produced at least some part of the sound on a scale from 0 to 4, where 0 = very unlikely and 4 = very likely

During this task, you should play and listen to a 5-second long sound. You will then be asked to think about what physically caused at least some part of the sound. The physical cause may not be the best word to describe the object making the sound - instead, focus on the physical action - for example, the vocalization of an animal may be “calling” or washing dishes may include "splashing" and "pouring".

A sound can have multiple causes that are likely, the listener is encouraged to assign multiple ‘mildly likely’ causes to a sound if none of them are very likely. Some of them are unlikely, but not impossible -- those should get a 1. Some of them aren’t for sure, but are fairly likely - thats a 3. The only time you should give a 0 is if you are very sure that the sound could not have been made by the specified physical cause.

Please try to concentrate on the task. Some answers are obvious, while others are not.


## Inter-annotator agreement: 

We computed Fleiss Kappa coefficient between the three MTurk annotators for the entire dataset, resulting in a coefficient of 0.23 - Fair Agreement. In addition, we computed correlation, for a selection of files, between annotations in two different Lab sessions and MTurk. Lab sessions consisted of CMU students carry on the annotation in an anechoic chamber.
