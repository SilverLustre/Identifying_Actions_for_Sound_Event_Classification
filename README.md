# Identifying_Actions_for_Sound_Event_Classification
In Psychology, actions are pivotal for humans to perceive and separate sound events. In Machine Learning, action recognition achieves high accuracy; however, it has not been asked if identifying actions can benefit Sound Event Classification (SEC), as opposed to semi-direct processing of the audio signal. Therefore, we propose a new Psychology-inspired approach for SEC that includes identification of actions via human listeners.
